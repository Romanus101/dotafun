# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

⚡️ Versioning note:  
DOTAFUN versions are tied to deployment numbers.  
- **v1.x.x** — first public release (initial playable version).  
- **v2.x.x** — major redesign after ~25 deployments.  
- Patch numbers (e.g. `2.3.61`) reflect incremental deployments and fixes.  
This way we don’t list all 130+ deployments, but only highlight the important milestones.
